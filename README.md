# Array Traversal Algorithms in Java

This repository contains **array traversal algorithms** implemented in Java.  
It’s designed to be expandable as more traversal patterns and utility classes are added.

## Current Features
- Spiral traversal of 2D arrays
- Tracking elements based on specific conditions (e.g., vowels)
- Cross Pattern Search: detect 3×3 regions with 'M' characters forming a cross
- Corner Pattern Search: detect 3×3 regions with 'R' characters in all four corners


## Future Features
- Snake traversal
- Zig-zag traversal
- Diagonal traversal
- Row-wise and column-wise patterns

## Notes
This repository is my independent work, developed and extended from exercises and ideas I practiced on CodeSignal.

## Usage

Compile and run Java files from the `src/main/java` folder. For example:

```bash
javac -d out src/main/java/com/app/*.java
java -cp out com.app.App
